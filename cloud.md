        WHY INSTILLING A DIGITAL CULTURE MATTERS ?
        Culture comprises the values and characteristic set of behaviors that define how things get done in an organization. A healthy culture provides the guidelines—the tacit code of conduct—that steer individuals to act appropriately and make choices that advance the organization’s goals and strategy. We see three important reasons for instilling a digital culture during a digital transformation.

        It promotes an external, rather than an internal, orientation.
        It prizes delegation over control
        It encourages boldness over caution
        It emphasizes more action and less planning.
        It values collaboration more than individual effort
   10. ARTICULATE, ACTIVATE, AND ALIGN: THREE STEPS TO A DIGITAL CULTURE
       Articulate the change required. When companies clearly define the behaviors that matter and their employees adhere to them, organizations can realize a strong culture and are more likely to reap results. (See the sidebar.) Yet leaders often stumble in this effort.
       Activate leadership characteristics and engage employees.ll high-performing cultures—especially digital ones—require strong leadership and engaged employees. In digital cultures, teams need to act autonomously, for example, and people must exercise judgment. But words alone aren’t enough to spur such behaviors. Leaders—whether they are in the C-suite or on the frontlines—must embrace and manifest these behaviors.  
       Align the organizational context to embed the new culture. Because a digital transformation represents a departure from the way a traditional business operates, companies typically test it using a pilot program run by the very best leaders. To elicit new behaviors from these executives, companies modify executives’ performance review criteria as well their areas of accountability. Companies also change these executives’ decision rights to accelerate decision making. When the pilot succeeds, these top leaders are ready to roll out the transformation. To successfully embed a new culture, companies need to anticipate what they need to do beyond running the pilot. They need to revisit their operating model. They also need to stimulate new practices by reviewing each one of the organizational context areas—leadership, organization design, performance management, people-development practices, resources and tools, vision and values, and informal interactions—and making specific changes that incentivize the right behaviors and discourage the undesirable ones. Changes should also be made to companies’ screening and hiring policies and practices to seek out prospects who exhibit the new behaviors. Companies can embed a new culture in a number of ways. For example, among other moves, L’Oréal hired a chief digital officer to lead a team that provides digital expertise to the company’s business units, while also advancing companywide digital priorities. Adobe Systems abolished its annual performance management reviews, replacing them with real-time “feed forward” sessions that focus on upcoming goals. And British Gas adopted Yammer as a corporate social collaboration platform; it allows people to share praise and best practices and work together across functions.
