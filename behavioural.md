       Where are you?
       Who are you with?
       What triggers the behavior and causes it to start?

### The Power of Bright-Line Rules
    1. A bright-line rule refers to a clearly defined rule or standard. It is a rule with clear interpretation and very little wiggle room. It establishes a bright line for what the rule is saying and what it is not saying.  e.g I only process email between 11AM and 6PM.
    2. Using Bright Lines to Break Bad Habits
    3. How Bright Lines Unleash Your Hidden Willpower
       First, bright lines shift the conversation in your head from one of sacrifice to one of empowerment.
       Second, by establishing clear decisions in your life, you conserve willpower for other important choices.

### How to Stick With Good Habits - Paper Clip Strategy
    1. Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving paperclips or hairpins or marbles—provide clear evidence of your progress. As a result, they reinforce your behavior and add little bit of immediate satisfaction to any activity.
    2. few reasons visual cues work well for building new good habits…
       Visual cues remind you to start a behavior.
       Visual cues display your progress on a behavior.
       Visual cues can have an additive effect on motivation.
       Visual cues can be used to drive short-term and long-term motivation.
    3. Creating Your Own Paper Clip Strategy
       Want to drink 8 glasses of water each day? Start with 8 paper clips and slide one over each time you finish a glass.

### Identity-Based Habits
    1. The key to building lasting habits is focusing on creating a new identity first.
    2. Three layers ( innermost to outside ) - Identity, Process and Outcomes
    3. Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.
    4. Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.
    5. e.g Want to become a better writer?
          Identity: Become the type of person who writes 1,000 words every day.
          Small win: Write one paragraph each day this week.

### Changing the Cues
    1. You can change a habit  by identifying and altering the cues that prompt your behavior
       e.g read more books by continually having 20-30 books on hold at the library
    2. Reduced exposure to negative cues
       e.g quit e-cigarettes with a combination of determination and also quitting coffee at the same time

### Habit Stacking
    1. refers to it as “anchoring” because you anchor—or stack—your new habit onto a current habit.
      e.g meditate for 20 minutes after brushing my teeth in the morning. Linking new habits onto a keystone one seems to work

### Environment Design
    1. The simple truth is our environment often shapes our behavior.
    2. For starters, you can break a bad habit by increasing the friction in your environment.
       e.g husband still loves his Pringles, as do I, but they’re now kept in a locked car that’s parked in the cold.
           The only way to turn off my alarm is to scan a QR Code I keep in the bathroom.
    3. we think of designing physical spaces, but you can use the same principles to shape your digital environment as well
       e.g I significantly cut down on mindless Instagram time. Simply logging out of the app makes a big difference.
    4. On the flip side, you can foster good habits by reducing the friction in your environment.
       e.g I've been running at 6 A.M. for the past two years. I always put my running gear (Garmin, compression sleeves, shoes, etc.) into a neat pile the night before. When I get up, I just get dressed and go out the door.

### Habit Substitution
    1. it can be more effective to replace your bad habit than to merely try to eliminate it.
       e.g replaced drinking beer every day in a succession of replacements, going through fruit juice, then iced tea, then seltzer water. I did it over about nine months by having one less drink a week. Once I finally quit, I got past the cravings in only two weeks

### Mindset Tricks
    1.  employ clever little mental tricks to stick with a good habit.
        e.g I quit smoking by saying a mantra out loud every time I wanted a cigarette (“your brain tricks you”) which I think changed my thinking from the subconscious part of my brain to the logical part

### Habit Tracking
    1. My favorite approach is to pick a very tiny version of your habit and track that
      e.g I have been tracking the habit of “reading 1 page” for the last month
