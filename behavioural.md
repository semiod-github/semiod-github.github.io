	Habits are the small decisions you make and actions you perform every day. According to researchers at Duke University, habits account for about 40 percent of our behaviors on any given day.

### How to Build a New Habit
    1. Start with an incredibly small habit.
    2. Increase your habit in very small ways.
    3. As you build up, break habits into chunks.
    4. When you slip, get back on track quickly.
    5. Be patient. Stick to a pace you can sustain.

###  How To Start New Habits That Actually Stick
    1. 4 Stges of Habit - Cue, carving, Response and Reward.
    2. The cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue.

### How to Break a Bad Habit
    1. What causes bad habits? Stress and boredom
    2. You don't eliminate a bad habit, you replace it.
    3. How to break a bad habit
       Choose a substitute for your bad habit
       Cut out as many triggers as possible
       Join forces with somebody.
       Surround yourself with people who live the way you want to live.
       Visualize yourself succeeding
       You don't need to be someone else, you just need to return to the old you.

       To Change Your Behavior, Change Your Environment 
    4. It's awareness that will show you how to actually make change.
       When does your bad habit actually happen?
       How many times do you do it each day?
       Where are you?
       Who are you with?
       What triggers the behavior and causes it to start?

### The Power of Bright-Line Rules
    1. A bright-line rule refers to a clearly defined rule or standard. It is a rule with clear interpretation and very little wiggle room. It establishes a bright line for what the rule is saying and what it is not saying.  e.g I only process email between 11AM and 6PM.
    2. Using Bright Lines to Break Bad Habits
    3. How Bright Lines Unleash Your Hidden Willpower
       First, bright lines shift the conversation in your head from one of sacrifice to one of empowerment.
       Second, by establishing clear decisions in your life, you conserve willpower for other important choices.

###  How to Stick to Your Goals When Life Gets Crazy
    1. Plan for Chaos
       - Reduce the Scope, Stick to the Schedule
       - The If-Then Technique - The If-Then Technique is the perfect way to plan for chaos and stick to your goals even when life gets crazy. Why? Because it forces you to create a strategy for reducing the scope, but sticking to the schedule before you actually need to do so.

### How to Stick With Good Habits - Paper Clip Strategy
    1. Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving paperclips or hairpins or marbles—provide clear evidence of your progress. As a result, they reinforce your behavior and add little bit of immediate satisfaction to any activity.
    2. few reasons visual cues work well for building new good habits…
       Visual cues remind you to start a behavior.
       Visual cues display your progress on a behavior.
       Visual cues can have an additive effect on motivation.
       Visual cues can be used to drive short-term and long-term motivation.
    3. Creating Your Own Paper Clip Strategy
       Want to drink 8 glasses of water each day? Start with 8 paper clips and slide one over each time you finish a glass.

### Identity-Based Habits
    1. The key to building lasting habits is focusing on creating a new identity first.
    2. Three layers ( innermost to outside ) - Identity, Process and Outcomes
    3. Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.
    4. Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.
    5. e.g Want to become a better writer?
          Identity: Become the type of person who writes 1,000 words every day.
          Small win: Write one paragraph each day this week.

### Changing the Cues
    1. You can change a habit  by identifying and altering the cues that prompt your behavior
       e.g read more books by continually having 20-30 books on hold at the library
    2. Reduced exposure to negative cues
       e.g quit e-cigarettes with a combination of determination and also quitting coffee at the same time

### Habit Stacking
    1. refers to it as “anchoring” because you anchor—or stack—your new habit onto a current habit.
      e.g meditate for 20 minutes after brushing my teeth in the morning. Linking new habits onto a keystone one seems to work

### Environment Design
    1. The simple truth is our environment often shapes our behavior.Life is a game and if you want to guarantee better results over a sustained period of time, the best approach is to play the game in an environment that favors you. Winners often win because their environment makes winning easier.
    2. For starters, you can break a bad habit by increasing the friction in your environment.
       e.g husband still loves his Pringles, as do I, but they’re now kept in a locked car that’s parked in the cold.
           The only way to turn off my alarm is to scan a QR Code I keep in the bathroom.
    3. we think of designing physical spaces, but you can use the same principles to shape your digital environment as well
       e.g I significantly cut down on mindless Instagram time. Simply logging out of the app makes a big difference.
    4. On the flip side, you can foster good habits by reducing the friction in your environment.
       e.g I've been running at 6 A.M. for the past two years. I always put my running gear (Garmin, compression sleeves, shoes, etc.) into a neat pile the night before. When I get up, I just get dressed and go out the door.
    5. 3 Strategies
	a. First, automate good decisions. Whenever possible, design an environment that makes good decisions for you. For example, buying smaller plates can help you lose weight by deciding portion size for you
        b. Second, get in the flow. A few years ago, PetSmart changed their checkout process. After swiping their credit card, customers were shown a screen that asked if they wanted to donate to “help save homeless animals.” Through this single strategy, PetSmart Charities raised $40 million in a year.
        c. Third, subtract the negative influences. Japanese television manufacturers rearranged their workspaces to save time by eliminating unnecessary turning, bending, and swiveling 

### Habit Substitution
    1. it can be more effective to replace your bad habit than to merely try to eliminate it.
       e.g replaced drinking beer every day in a succession of replacements, going through fruit juice, then iced tea, then seltzer water. I did it over about nine months by having one less drink a week. Once I finally quit, I got past the cravings in only two weeks

### Mindset Tricks
    1.  employ clever little mental tricks to stick with a good habit.
        e.g I quit smoking by saying a mantra out loud every time I wanted a cigarette (“your brain tricks you”) which I think changed my thinking from the subconscious part of my brain to the logical part

### Habit Tracking
    1. My favorite approach is to pick a very tiny version of your habit and track that
      e.g I have been tracking the habit of “reading 1 page” for the last month 

### Military Strategy to Build Better Habits
    1. In war, the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won.
    2. Military tactics are like water. For water, in its natural course, runs away from high places and hastens downwards. So, in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and strike at what is weak.

### The Chemistry of Building Better Habits
    1. Every habit has an activation energy that is required to get started. The smaller the habit, the less energy you need to start.
    2. Catalysts lower the activation energy required to start a new habit. Optimizing your environment is the best way to do this in the real world. In the right environment, every habit is easier.
    3. Even simple habits often have intermediate steps. Eliminate the intermediate steps with the highest activation energy and your habits will be easier to accomplish.

### Temptation Bundle
    1. You're going to create a two-column list:
       In column one, write down the pleasures you enjoy and the temptations that you want to do.
       In column two, write down the tasks and behaviors you should be doing, but often procrastinate on.
       Take your time and write down as many behaviors as possible. Then, browse your list and see if you can link one of your instantly gratifying “want” behaviors with something you “should” be doing.
    2. Here are a few common examples of temptation bundling:
       Only listen to audiobooks or podcasts you love while exercising.
       Only get a pedicure while processing overdue work emails.
       Only watch your favorite show while ironing or doing household chores.
       Only eat at your favorite restaurant when conducting your monthly meeting with a difficult colleague.

### Use This Simple Daily Habit to Add More Gratitude to Your Life
    1. When I sit down to eat dinner, I say one thing that I am grateful for happening today.
    2. why it works
	Positive thinking opens your eyes to more opportunities.
	The individual impact of any one piece of gratitude is small, but the cumulative effect is huge.
	You start to realize how insignificant monetary things are for your day-to-day happiness.
	I have stuck with the habit because it is stupidly small.
	I have stuck with the habit because it is perfectly tied to another behavior.
### The One Word That Drives Senseless and Irrational Habit
    There are two important lessons we can take away from Langer's study.
    1. If you’re going to ask someone for a favor, be sure to use the word because and give the person a reason to fulfill the favor.
    2. We use reasons—both logical and illogical—to justify our own behavior.The reasons that we use to guide our behavior are just stories that we tell ourselves. Sometimes, those stories are true and accurate. We all have reasons for why now isn’t the right time for that bold move, why we slip up on habits that we say are important to us, and, yes, why we do favors for strangers. What we often fail to realize, however, is that our behaviors can just as easily be driven by irrational reasons as logical ones.
